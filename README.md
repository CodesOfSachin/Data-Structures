# Data Strucures in JavaScript 

### 1.  Set Data Structure:- 

>  A Set is a data structure that can hold collection of values. The values howver must be unique.
>  Set can contain a mix of different data types. You can store strings, booleans, numbers or even objects all in same set.
>  Sets are dynamically sized. You don't have to declare the size of a set before creating it.
>  Sets do not maintain an insertion order.
>  Sets are iterables. They can be used with a for of loop.

##   Set vs Array

>  Arrays can contain duplicate values whereas Set can't.
>  Insertion order is maintained in Arrays but it's not the case with Sets.
>  Searchin and deleting an element in the Set is faster compared to Arrays.
